## Upgrading from Version 1.* to Version 2.*

From version 2 we added support for multi-currency. First of all, make sure that you [migrated the Price module](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/mg-price). We have changed collector dependency to use `PriceProduct` module instead of price, please update your code accordingly if you overwrote the core.
