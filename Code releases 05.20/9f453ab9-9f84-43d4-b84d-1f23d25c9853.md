After you have [created a return](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/shop-guide-creating-a-return) for order or a Shop Owner has done it for you, you can [print the return slip](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/return-management-feature-overview).

To print the return slip:

1. Go to *My Account > Returns* page.
2. In the Actions column next to the return you want to print the return slip for, click **Print Slip**. This takes you to the print version of the return slip.
