## Multiple Payments
Spryker Commerce OS enables to have multiple payments per checkout. Payments are stored in `QuoteTransfer::payments` and persisted when `CheckoutClient::placeOrder` is called in last checkout step.

Each payment method must provide payment amount it shares from order grand total. This amount is stored in `PaymentTransfer::amount` field. When order is placed in last step all payments are persisted to `spy_sales_payment` table.

## Payment Hydration for Order
The [Sales](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/sales) module provides plugins to hydrate OrderTransfer which is called when `SalesFacade::getOrderByIdSalesOrder` invoked.

One of those plugins is `\Spryker\Zed\SalesPayment\Communication\Plugin\Sales\SalesPaymentOrderExpanderPlugin` which must be added to `\Pyz\Zed\Sales\SalesDependencyProvider::getOrderHydrationPlugins` plugin stack.

The plugin will receive `OrderTransfer` which is the payment you need to hydrate with additional data.

Plugins have to populate the `PaymentTransfer` object and return it back. After this step you should be able to get payment information when calling `SalesFacade::getOrderByIdSalesOrder`. We also included simple Zed UI twig block for payments so it can display a little more information about payment methods used on the Order Detail page.

To enable it:

* Go to `\Pyz\Zed\Sales\SalesConfig::getSalesDetailExternalBlocksUrls`
* Add` ‘payments’ => ‘/payment/sales/list’`, to `$projectExternalBlocks` array.
