In this guide we are going to launch an existing Spryker project in Docker containers on a local developemnt machine,
using Docker SDK.

In case you don't have a Spryker Project yet or want to start with a fresh installation, 
we recommend starting with complete Installation guides:
* [Installing Spryker with Docker](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/installing-spryker-with-docker)


### Installing Docker

For Docker installation instructions, see one of the following:
* [Installing Docker prerequisites on MacOS](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/installing-docker-prerequisites-on-macos)
* [Installing Docker prerequisites on Linux](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/installing-docker-prerequisites-on-linux)
* [Installing Docker prerequisites on Windows](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/installing-docker-prerequisites-on-windows)

### Adding Docker SDK to Spryker Project

To set up a local project with the Docker SDK:

1. Using a terminal navigate to your project root folder, there you can find src/ directory and composer.json file.

2. Clone the latest version of the Docker SDK into the project root folder:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:spryker/docker-sdk.git docker
```


## Launching a developer environemnt

To set up a developer environment:

1. Bootstrap docker setup, build and start the instance:

```bash
docker/sdk boot deploy.dev.yml
docker/sdk up
```

2. Switch to your project branch, re-build the application with assets and demo data from the new branch:

```bash
git checkout {your_branch}
docker/sdk boot deploy.dev.yml
docker/sdk up --build --assets --data
```

Depending on your requirements, you can select any combination of the following `up` command attributes. To fetch all the changes from the branch you switch to, we recommend running the command with all of them:
- `--build` - update composer, generate transfer objects, etc.
- `--assets` - build assets
- `--data` - fetch new demo data

Here you go! Now every Spryker Application of your project is running in a separate Docker container and
you can continue writing amazing code using Docker environment!
