The StepEngine module provides an easy way to define multi-step pages with forms.

Using this module you can define `Steps` and additionally you can link forms to interact with the user.

This is useful in handling the checkout process where you can define multiple steps, such as:

* select payment method;
* select shipment method;
* enter voucher code;
* view order summary.

Every form can have its own. The transfer object of a particular step is injected into the main transfer object by the StepEngine, after it is filled with the user data from its corresponding form.
