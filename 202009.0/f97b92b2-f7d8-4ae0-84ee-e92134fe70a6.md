The Return Management API allows developers to retrieve return information and create a return. The list of retrievable information includes: 

* Sales order items that a Buyer can return
* Returns per customer
* Predefined reasons stored in the database

In your development, the API can help you:

* View order details, including returnable or non-returnable items
* Create returns for the returnable items
* View return details of a specific customer
* Specify reasons for returning the sales order items

 
:::(Warning) (Authentication)
Since the Return Management feature is available for logged-in users only, the endpoints provided by the API cannot be accessed anonymously. For this reason, you always need to pass a user's authentication token in your REST requests. For details on how to authenticate a user and retrieve the token, see Authentication and Authorization.
