This document describes how to configure basic htaccess authentication for the Storefront and the Back Office.

To set up htaccess authentication, follow the instructions below.

## 1. Defining login details and endpoints
To define login details and endpoints:

1. Add login details to `deploy.*.yml` of the desired environment as follows:

```yaml
version: "0.1"

x-frontend-auth: &frontend-auth
    auth:
        engine: basic
        users:
            - username: {secure_username} # Replace the placeholder and the brackets with the actual username
              password: {secure_password} # Replace the placeholder and the brackets with the actual password
``` 

2. In the same `deploy.*.yml`, define the endpoints that should be protected by adding `<<: *frontend-auth` to each desired endpoint as follows:

```yaml
...
groups:
    EU:
        region: EU
        applications:
            yves_eu:
                application: yves
                endpoints:
                    date-time-configurator-example.spryker.local:
                        entry-point: Configurator
                    yves.de.spryker.local:
                        store: DE
                        <<: *frontend-auth
                        services:
...
```
4. Bootstrap the docker setup with the adjusted deploy file:
```bash
docker/sdk boot deploy.*.yml
```

5. Once the job finishes, build and start the instance:
```bash
docker/sdk up
```

:::(Warning) (Verification)
Open a protected endpoint and make sure that you are prompted to enter the defined username and password.
:::

You've configured basic authentication.

## 2. Excluding IP addresses from htaccess authentication

To allow clients with desired IP addresses to bypass htaccess authentication, adjust the `deploy.*.yml` of the desired environment as follows:
```bash
version: "0.1"

x-frontend-auth: &frontend-auth
    auth:
        engine: basic
        users:
            - username: {secure_username} # Replace the placeholder and the brackets with the actual username.
              password: {secure_password} # Replace the placeholder and the brackets with the actual password.
        exclude:
              {ip_address} # Replace the placeholder and the brackets with the actual ip address.
```

:::(Warning) (Verification)
Open a protected endpoint from the excluded IP address and make sure that you are not prompted to enter the login details.
:::

You've excluded IP addresses from authentication.
